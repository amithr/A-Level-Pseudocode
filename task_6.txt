1. Create a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns
    - Each row represents the grades for an individual student
2. Write a procedure that prints out all the elements in a row based 
on the index of that row
3. Write a function to calculate the average of all grades in the 2D array.
4. Write a procedure that outputs the position(s) of a specific grade in a 2D array.

DECLARE Grades : ARRAY[1:3][1:4] OF INTEGER

// Let's pretend we've already initialized this array with values

PROCEDURE PrintArray()
    FOR I <- 1 to 3
        FOR J <- 1 to 4
            OUTPUT Grades[I][J]
        NEXT J
    NEXT I
ENDPROCEDURE

FUNCTION Average() RETURNS REAL
    DECLARE Sum: INTEGER
    DECLARE Count: INTEGER
    DECLARE Average: REAL

    FOR I <- 1 to 3
        FOR J <- 1 to 4
            Sum <- Sum + Grades[I][J]
            Count <- Count + 1
        NEXT J
    NEXT I
    Average <- Sum/Count
    RETURN Average
ENDFUNCTION

PROCEDURE FindGrade(Grade:Integer)
    DECLARE Row:INTEGER
    DECLARE Integer:INTEGER

    FOR I <- 1 to 3
        FOR J <- 1 to 4
            IF GRADES[I][J] = Grade THEN
                Row <- I
                Column <- J
        NEXT J
    NEXT I
    OUTPUT I ,",", J
