1. Write a FOR loop that outputs all of the odd numbers from 0 to 20.
2. Rewrite this with a REPEAT loop.
3. Do the above, except with the user inputting the minimum and maximum values.
4. Wrap the whole REPEAT loop in a procedure and call it.

// 1 to 20 (by 1)
FOR Counter <- 1 TO 20
    OUTPUT Counter
NEXT Counter

FOR Counter <- 1 TO 20 STEP 2
    OUTPUT Counter
NEXT Counter

DECLARE Counter:INTEGER
Counter <- 1
REPEAT
    OUTPUT Counter
    Counter <- Counter + 1
NEXT Counter <= 20
