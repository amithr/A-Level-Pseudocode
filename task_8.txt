1. Create a sentence with at least 5 words and store it in a string.
2. Write a function to calculate the number of words in the array.
3. Write a function to return the words as an array
4. Write a method to find the position of a word in an array, if it exists.
5. Write a function to join an array of strings into one string, 
with each string separated by a comma.
6. Write a function to find how many times a specific character is in a string.


DECLARE Sentence:STRING
DECLARE Name:STRING
DECLARE NewString: STRING
Sentence <- "Hello, my name is Amith Ravindar."

// Returns the rightmost 5 characters
RIGHT(Sentence, 5)

// Returns the leftmost 5 characters
LEFT(Sentence, 5)

MID(Sentence, 5, 8)

// Joins (concatenates) both strings
NewString <- Sentence & Name

LENGTH(Sentence)

------

DECLARE ArrayChars: ARRAY[1:LENGTH(SENTENCE)] OF CHAR
FOR I=0 TO LENGTH(SENTENCE) - 1
    ArrayChars[I] <- MID(SENTENCE(I:I+1))
