1. Get a grade as integer user input.
2. Output a message based on the grade (90-100, 80-89, 70-79)
3. Do this using switch statements.

DECLARE Grade:INTEGER

// Validation
WHILE GRADE > 100 AND GRADE < 0
    OUTPUT "Enter a grade:"
    INPUT Grade 
ENDWHILE

IF GRADE >= 90 AND GRADE <= 100 THEN
    OUTPUT "Good job!"
ENDIF

IF GRADE >= 80 AND GRADE <= 89 THEN
    OUTPUT "Not bad!"
ENDIF

IF GRADE >= 79 AND GRADE <= 70 THEN
    OUTPUT "Average"
ENDIF

CASE OF Grade
    90 TO 100: OUTPUT "Good job!"
    80 TO 89: OUTPUT "Not bad!"
    70 TO 79: OUTPUT "Average"
