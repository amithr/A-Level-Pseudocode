1. Create a custom Student data types which contains their name (String), 
student ID (String), birth date (Date), and their current GPA (decimal).
2. Create a student record.
3. Store this in an array.
4. Calculate the average GPA of all these students by iterating through the array.
5. Enumerated Type

TYPE Student
    DECLARE Name: STRING
    DECLARE Id: STRING
    DECLARE BirthDate: DATE
    DECLARE GradePointAverage: REAL
ENDTYPE

DECLARE Student1: Student
DECLARE StudentArray: ARRAY[1:30] OF Student

Student1.Name <- "John Smith"
Student1.Id <- "X387F"
Student.BirthDate <- 30/05/2012
Student.GradePointAverage  <- 3.21

StudentArray[0] <- Student1

// Assume there are 30 other records
DECLARE Sum: REAL
FOR I <- 1 TO 30
    Sum <- Sum + StudentArray[I].GradePointAverage
NEXT I

--------

STATUS = (Honors, Pass, Failure)
